# Presentation Copy Improvements
*Focus: How do we solve problems for our customers?*

## Key Improvements

### 1. Reframe Solution Slides (Slides 3 & 4)
Instead of feature lists, lead with the customer problem:

**Conversational AI + Dashboard:**
- **Current**: "Automate customer support, sales, and operations..."
- **Better**: "Your team is drowning in repetitive calls while customers wait. We turn every interaction into instant, 24/7 supportâ€”without hiring."

**Data & Operations Platform:**
- **Current**: "Turn your data swamp into a single source of truth..."
- **Better**: "Your executives can't make decisions because data lives in 50 different places. We give you one dashboard with answers you can trust."

---

### 2. Add a "Who This Is For" Slide (After Solutions)
Replace or add before case studies:
- Show the 6 client avatars with their #1 pain point
- Format: "CX Leaders losing 30% of calls â†’ 24/7 AI agents"
- Visual: Icons + role + problem + solution in grid

**Example Content:**
```
CX Leaders â†’ Stop losing 30% of calls to voicemail
Data Directors â†’ End the data swamp chaos
COOs/Founders â†’ Scale without hiring
VP Logistics â†’ Automate "Where's my order?" calls
Home Services â†’ Capture after-hours emergency calls
Financial Services â†’ Meet regulatory response times
```

---

### 3. Revise Problem Slide (Slide 2)
Make it more specific with numbers:

**Current cards are good, but add impact:**
- "Slow Response Times" â†’ "30% of customer calls go unanswered"
- "Disconnected Data" â†’ "Your team wastes 10 hours/week finding the right data"
- "Broken Automations" â†’ "Failed integrations cost you $50K+ annually"
- "Empty AI Promises" â†’ "Most 'AI' solutions take 6+ months to see ROI"

---

### 4. Add ROI/Impact Before Pricing (New Slide)
Before Budget & Timeline, show value:

**"What You Get in Return"**
- Stop losing $100K+/year in unanswered calls
- Cut operational costs by 60%
- Scale without hiring
- Launch in weeks, not months

---

### 5. Simplify Case Studies (Slides 7-9)
Lead each with the customer's problem:

**Vana:**
- **The Problem**: Manual debt collection, limited hours, 60% of budget spent on agents
- **The Solution**: AI agent that works 24/7 across all channels
- **The Result**: 25% higher recovery, 60% cost savings, $1M â†’ $9M in 2 months

**Sakon:**
- **The Problem**: Enterprise customers can't get answers, support team overwhelmed
- **The Solution**: AI assistant trained on entire knowledge base
- **The Result**: 70% fewer tickets, 90% satisfaction, 3x faster responses

**McDonald's:**
- **The Problem**: High call volume, inconsistent accuracy, limited phone hours
- **The Solution**: Voice AI for WhatsApp, phone, drive-thru orders
- **The Result**: 99.9% uptime, 30% cost reduction, 98% accuracy

---

### 6. Update "How It Works" (Slide 6)
Make Step 1 more problem-focused:

**"1. Let's Talk"**
- **Current**: "Book a 15-min call..."
- **Better**: "Tell us what's breaking. We'll show you how to fix it in 15 minutes."

**Complete Flow:**
1. **Tell us what's breaking** - 15-min call to understand your pain points
2. **AI Product Discovery** - We identify the highest-ROI automation opportunities
3. **Build a Prototype** - See it working in 2-3 weeks
4. **Scale Together** - Launch in 6-10 weeks with ongoing support

---

### 7. Add a "Why Now?" Slide (Before Final CTA)
Create urgency:

**"Why Now?"**
- Your competitors are already using AI
- Every day you wait = lost revenue and customer churn
- Q4 peak season is coming
- 2025 budgets are being set now
- The technology is proven (see our case studies)

---

### 8. Strengthen Final CTA (Slide 12)
Make it more specific:

**Current**: "We bet on grit, creativity, and execution"

**Better**:
```
Stop Losing Customers to Slow Response Times

Get your AI agent live in 6 weeks:
1. Book a 15-min call
2. See your custom demo
3. Launch in weeks

ðŸ“§ ed@sidetool.co
```

- Or: "60+ Ways We Can Automate Your Biggest Pain Points"

**Budget & Timeline:**
- Lead with: "Most agencies charge 2x and take 6+ months. Here's our pricing:"
- Add: "Launch production-ready AI in 6-10 weeks â€” not 6 months"

**Problem Slide Header:**
- Keep: "Ops and data teams are stuck in broken processes"
- Add subheader with impact: "And it's costing you $100K+ annually"

---

## The Core Message Shift

**From**: "Here's what we build and how we build it"

**To**: "Here's the money you're losing, here's how we stop it, here's proof it works"

### Every Slide Should Answer:
1. What problem does this solve?
2. How much is this problem costing you?
3. How fast can we fix it?
